## 1. Executive summary

Maconellicoccus hirsutus (pink hibiscus mealybug, PHM) is a highly polyphagous pseudococcid native to southern Asia that has invaded much of the tropics and subtropics, attacking more than 70–80 plant families and over 200 genera, with preference for woody hosts such as hibiscus, cotton, citrus, grape, and several Annona spp. including custard apple and sugar apple. It causes severe stunting, leaf and shoot malformation, “bunchy top”, fruit deformation, sooty mold, and yield loss, and is recognized as a quarantine pest in many regions (EPPO, CABI, EU pest categorisation).

### Key biological parameters (core values at favorable temperatures)

| Parameter | Typical value / range | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reproduction mode | Sexual; males present but females predominant | Some reports of facultative parthenogenesis, but sexual reproduction dominates on major hosts. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/) |
| Fecundity per female | ~150–600 eggs (commonly 260–300 at 20–27 °C; ≈100 at 30 °C) [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/) | Laid in cottony ovisac on stems, leaves, fruit. |
| Development time (egg–adult, ♀) | ≈29–35 days at 25–27 °C on hibiscus; longer at 20 °C and 30+ °C. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/) | Multiple overlapping generations per year in tropics. |
| Optimal temperature for development | ≈25–27 °C (female development and reproduction). [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf) | |
| Female thermal thresholds | Lower ≈14–15 °C, upper ≈29–30 °C for development. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf) | EPPO datasheet for females. |
| Degree‑days (egg–adult, ♀) | ≈260–300 degree‑days above base (varies by study/host; EPPO/Chong values). [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf) | Use host/region‑specific calibration. |
| Adult longevity | Females ≈20–30 d at 25–27 °C; males a few days. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/) | Males short‑lived, do not feed. |
| Generations per year | 8–10 or more in tropical climates; fewer in subtropics. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf) | Strongly climate‑dependent. |

### Critical growth stages (conceptual “diagram”)

Text description you can convert into a figure:

1. Eggs laid in white cottony ovisac on tender shoots, leaves, fruit surface or under calyx. Eggs hatch in about 3–6 days depending on temperature. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/)
2. First‑instar crawlers disperse on plant surface and via wind, ants, and human activity; settle near veins, shoots, or young fruits. [mrec.ifas.ufl](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/lso/mealybug/The%20Pink%20Hibiscus%20Mealybug.pdf)
3. Female pathway: three active nymphal instars, then adult female with heavy wax and ovisac production; male pathway: two nymphal instars plus non‑feeding prepupa and pupa inside a cocoon, then short‑lived winged adult. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/jipm/article/6/1/5/2936972)
4. Strong population build‑up on tender flush, inflorescences, and developing fruits; honeydew and sooty mold develop; natural enemies (notably Anagyrus kamali and predators such as Cryptolaemus) can provide high mortality if conserved or augmented. [caribbeaninvasives](https://caribbeaninvasives.org/index.php/2022/10/25/ias-spotlight-pink-hibiscus-mealybug/)

### Top 5 management recommendations (with custard apple emphasis)

1. **Conserve and augment biological control**, especially releases of parasitoid Anagyrus kamali and predators like Cryptolaemus montrouzieri and Scymnus spp., which have suppressed PHM in many regions and are compatible with Annona orchards. [semanticscholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/INSECT-PESTS-OF-CUSTARD-APPLE-(Annona-squamosa-L.)-Naik/ec29dc2eba40fb69dcefe082e661a90c17e82aa7)
2. **Monitor systematically** by inspecting tender shoots, flower clusters, and developing fruits (including under calyx) at weekly intervals from bud break through fruit development; record infestation levels per shoot/fruit to trigger action. [agronomyjournals](https://www.agronomyjournals.com/archives/2024/vol7issue9S/PartM/S-7-9-127-471.pdf)
3. **Implement cultural measures**: remove and destroy heavily infested twigs and mummified fruits, control ant populations (tree bands, selective baits), prune for aeration, avoid excessive nitrogen, and ensure clean nursery/planting material. [agronomyjournals](https://www.agronomyjournals.com/archives/2024/vol7issue9S/PartM/S-7-9-127-471.pdf)
4. **Use selective insecticides only as a last resort**, targeting crawler emergence with contact or systemic products that are less disruptive to parasitoids and predators; avoid broad‑spectrum organophosphates/pyrethroids that collapse natural enemy complexes. [entomoljournal](https://www.entomoljournal.com/archives/2017/vol5issue5/PartN/5-5-86-227.pdf)
5. **Integrate weather‑based forecasting**, using local temperature data and published degree‑day relationships to anticipate peak crawler activity and align biological and (if necessary) chemical interventions, particularly in monsoon‑influenced regions like Maharashtra. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/)

## 2. Detailed sections (selected key elements)

Below are condensed answers for several of your major sections, emphasizing parameters and custard apple interaction that are well supported in the accessible literature you pointed toward.

### 2.1 Taxonomy, identification, distribution

- Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green) is a mealybug (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) described originally from southern Asia and now widely recognized by EPPO and CABI as an invasive, quarantine‑relevant pest. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI)
- It is highly polyphagous, recorded on hosts from about 73–78 families and more than 200–220 genera; preferred hosts include Hibiscus rosa‑sinensis, cotton, citrus, grapevine, and several Annonaceae. [krishikosh.egranth.ac](https://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/server/api/core/bitstreams/b23629a2-f8eb-4c39-a16b-747f20260744/content)

Morphological highlights (synthesized from datasheets and reviews):

- Eggs: small, oval, pale orange to pinkish, laid in dense cottony ovisacs on stems, leaves, twigs, or fruit surfaces; ovisac can contain several hundred eggs. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf)
- Crawlers: tiny (~0.3 mm), yellowish‑pink, with limited walking ability but easily dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity. [cabidigitallibrary](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/cabicompendium.40171)
- Female nymphs and adults: pink body covered with white mealy wax, with short waxy filaments and a more or less oval body outline; adult females are wingless and sessile once established. [mrec.ifas.ufl](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/lso/mealybug/The%20Pink%20Hibiscus%20Mealybug.pdf)
- Adult males: much smaller, delicate, with wings and only two functional legs; do not feed and survive only a few days; prepupal and pupal stages occur in a cocoon‑like structure. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/jipm/article/6/1/5/2936972)
- Diagnostic features distinguishing PHM from other mealybugs include the distinctive pink body color beneath wax, the dense ovisac, and the characteristic bunchy‑top symptom on hosts; EPPO and CABI datasheets provide keys to separate it from Ferrisia and other Maconellicoccus species. [cabidigitallibrary](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/cabicompendium.40171)

Distribution and invasion history:

- Native to southern Asia, with subsequent spread to Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and parts of North America and North Africa largely through trade in infested plant material. [cabi](https://www.cabi.org/uploads/dmpp/free-distribution-maps/map-100-maconellicoccus-hirsutus.pdf)
- In India it is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical states and has been recorded on custard apple and other fruit crops; Ghose (1972) cited custard apple (A. squamosa) as an important alternate host in grapevine orchards. [krishikosh.egranth.ac](https://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/server/api/core/bitstreams/b23629a2-f8eb-4c39-a16b-747f20260744/content)
- EPPO and EU pest categorisation list M. hirsutus as a regulated non‑EU pest, with specific phytosanitary measures for host commodities. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/download/standard/194/pm7-070-1-en.pdf)

### 2.2 Life cycle, temperature, degree‑days, voltinism

Core life‑history and temperature biology:

- Lab studies on hibiscus at 15–35 °C show fastest development around 27 °C, with a generation completed in roughly 29 days; development slows at 15 and 35 °C and survival drops at extremes. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/)
- EPPO cites minimum and maximum developmental thresholds for females of about 14.5 °C and 29 °C, with optimum temperatures around 25–27 °C; a generation can be completed in ~5–6 weeks under favorable field conditions. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf)
- Fecundity is strongly temperature‑dependent: 260–300 eggs per mated female at 20–27 °C, but only about 100 eggs at 30 °C in one detailed life‑history study. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/)

Degree‑day parameters and voltinism (from Chong et al. and syntheses):

- Using linear models, lower developmental thresholds for females have been estimated around 14–15 °C, with total heat requirements on the order of a few hundred degree‑days for egg‑to‑adult development; exact constants vary slightly among studies and hosts. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/jipm/article/6/1/5/2936972)
- In tropical climates, accumulation of heat units supports 8–10 or more overlapping generations per year; in warm subtropics, 4–6 generations are typical depending on winter temperatures and host phenology. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8749475/)
- Seasonal phenology studies show peak populations on many hosts coincide with periods of warm temperatures and flush growth; in monsoon‑influenced climates, this tends to align with late spring–monsoon onset and again late monsoon on regrowth flushes. [semanticscholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/INSECT-PESTS-OF-CUSTARD-APPLE-(Annona-squamosa-L.)-Naik/ec29dc2eba40fb69dcefe082e661a90c17e82aa7)

Life‑table work:

- Life‑table and population‑growth analyses report maximum finite rates of increase around 1.12–1.16 females per female per day and shortest doubling times (~4–6 days) between about 25–35 °C, confirming strong potential for rapid outbreaks in warm climates. [academia](https://www.academia.edu/30855450/Studies_on_life_cycle_of_mealybug_Maconellicoccus_hirsutus_Green_Hemiptera_Pseudococcidae_on_different_hosts_at_different_constant_temperatures)

### 2.3 Host interactions with Annona (custard apple, sugar apple)

Evidence specific to custard apple:

- Indian work has identified custard apple (Annona squamosa) as an important alternative host for M. hirsutus in grape‑growing regions, and more recent studies from Chhattisgarh report serious infestations on custard apple with biological observations and management trials. [krishikosh.egranth.ac](https://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/server/api/core/bitstreams/b23629a2-f8eb-4c39-a16b-747f20260744/content)
- A Krishikosh thesis and related agronomy journal paper from 2024 describe incidence, biology, and management of M. hirsutus on custard apple in Kanker district, including effects on fruit nutritional content; these are crucial sources for the Annona‑specific aspects you want. [agronomyjournals](https://www.agronomyjournals.com/archives/2024/vol7issue9S/PartM/S-7-9-127-471.pdf)

From these and general PHM biology you can infer:

- On custard apple trees, colonization typically starts on tender shoots and leaves, then extends to flower buds and young fruits; ovisacs are often found on fruit pedicels and beneath the calyx where insects are protected from sprays. [semanticscholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/INSECT-PESTS-OF-CUSTARD-APPLE-(Annona-squamosa-L.)-Naik/ec29dc2eba40fb69dcefe082e661a90c17e82aa7)
- Peak vulnerability likely aligns with bud break, vegetative flush, flowering, and early fruit set—stages with abundant young tissue and high sap flow—similar to PHM dynamics on hibiscus and grape. [krishikosh.egranth.ac](https://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/server/api/core/bitstreams/b23629a2-f8eb-4c39-a16b-747f20260744/content)
- Damage on Annona includes leaf curling, distortion and stunting of terminals (“bunchy” growth), fruit malformation, sooty mold on honeydew, and premature fruit drop; Indian surveys report yield reductions and quality losses when infestations are unchecked. [agronomyjournals](https://www.agronomyjournals.com/archives/2024/vol7issue9S/PartM/S-7-9-127-471.pdf)

Custard apple phenology and risk (synthesis using Indian pest‑on‑custard‑apple papers):

- Dormancy: relatively low active infestation but pest can persist on remaining green twigs or alternate hosts nearby. [semanticscholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/INSECT-PESTS-OF-CUSTARD-APPLE-(Annona-squamosa-L.)-Naik/ec29dc2eba40fb69dcefe082e661a90c17e82aa7)
- Bud break and vegetative flush: high risk as crawlers colonize new growth; early monitoring and biological control are important. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/jipm/article/6/1/5/2936972)
- Flowering and fruit set: critical stages, because distortion and bunching of floral clusters and early fruit drop have direct yield impacts; studies in Indian orchards note reduction in fruit set where PHM is unmanaged. [agronomyjournals](https://www.agronomyjournals.com/archives/2024/vol7issue9S/PartM/S-7-9-127-471.pdf)
- Fruit development and maturation: risk of cosmetic damage, deformation, cracking, heavy sooty mold, and secondary disease entry; this is often when farmers notice the pest and resort to insecticides. [mrec.ifas.ufl](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/lso/mealybug/The%20Pink%20Hibiscus%20Mealybug.pdf)

### 2.4 Dispersal and ecological interactions

Dispersal:

- Crawlers are the main dispersal stage; they walk short distances on the plant, but because of their small size and wax filaments they are readily carried by wind, rain splash, animals, and human activities. [cabidigitallibrary](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/cabicompendium.40171)
- Long‑distance spread is primarily via infested planting material, ornamental plants, fruits, and nursery stock; CABI and EPPO emphasise this in their risk assessments. [cabi](https://www.cabi.org/uploads/dmpp/free-distribution-maps/map-100-maconellicoccus-hirsutus.pdf)

Ant associations and natural enemies:

- PHM produces abundant honeydew that attracts tending ants, which protect colonies from predators and parasitoids; ant exclusion improves biological control in several systems, though quantitative custard‑apple‑specific data are sparse. [mrec.ifas.ufl](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/lso/mealybug/The%20Pink%20Hibiscus%20Mealybug.pdf)
- The encyrtid parasitoid Anagyrus kamali has been widely introduced and has achieved high parasitism levels and strong suppression of PHM in the Caribbean and other invaded regions; it attacks nymphal and young adult stages. [caribbeaninvasives](https://caribbeaninvasives.org/index.php/2022/10/25/ias-spotlight-pink-hibiscus-mealybug/)
- Predators including the coccinellids Cryptolaemus montrouzieri and Scymnus spp., and chrysopid lacewings (Chrysoperla spp.), prey on PHM eggs and nymphs and are part of IPM programs, including in Indian fruit crops. [entomoljournal](https://www.entomoljournal.com/archives/2017/vol5issue5/PartN/5-5-86-227.pdf)

### 2.5 IPM with emphasis on Indian custard apple

Indian context:

- Custard apple is cultivated on tens of thousands of hectares in India; reports from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and other states highlight PHM as one of the key mealybug pests limiting yield and fruit quality. [krishikosh.egranth.ac](https://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/server/api/core/bitstreams/b23629a2-f8eb-4c39-a16b-747f20260744/content)
- Krishikosh and state agricultural university documents provide locally adapted recommendations combining cultural, biological, and chemical tactics, including work under rainfed and tribal farming systems. [semanticscholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/INSECT-PESTS-OF-CUSTARD-APPLE-(Annona-squamosa-L.)-Naik/ec29dc2eba40fb69dcefe082e661a90c17e82aa7)

Core IPM components (drawn from UF PHM management bulletin, JIPM review, and Indian sources):

- Monitoring and thresholds: regular inspection of 10–20 randomly selected trees per orchard, checking specified numbers of shoots and fruits per tree; while formal economic thresholds on custard apple are not yet standardized, some Indian work uses presence of colonies on a certain percentage of shoots/fruits as an action criterion. [mrec.ifas.ufl](https://mrec.ifas.ufl.edu/lso/mealybug/The%20Pink%20Hibiscus%20Mealybug.pdf)
- Cultural control: pruning and destruction of infested twigs, removal of alternate host weeds and volunteer plants, sanitation of orchards and nursery stock, control of honeydew‑tending ants, and adjustment of fertilizer to avoid lush, highly susceptible growth flushes. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/jipm/article/6/1/5/2936972)
- Biological control: conservation of existing parasitoids and predators by minimizing broad‑spectrum insecticides, and where available, augmentative releases of A. kamali and predators like C. montrouzieri; Caribbean and Florida programs show substantial long‑term suppression using this strategy. [caribbeaninvasives](https://caribbeaninvasives.org/index.php/2022/10/25/ias-spotlight-pink-hibiscus-mealybug/)
- Chemical control: if required, use selective insecticides (e.g., buprofezin, certain neonicotinoids or IGRs consistent with Indian label regulations) applied at crawler stages and targeting undersides of leaves and fruit calyx areas; repeated sprays at 2–3‑week intervals may be necessary, but Indian and international guidance stress reserving this for high‑pressure situations to preserve biological control. [entomoljournal](https://www.entomoljournal.com/archives/2017/vol5issue5/PartN/5-5-86-227.pdf)

## 3. Knowledge gaps (relative to your outline)

Several of the very fine‑grained parameters you requested are poorly documented or scattered, especially in relation to custard apple:

- Detailed stage‑specific duration tables for PHM on Annona at multiple constant temperatures (15–35 °C) are limited; most life‑table work is on hibiscus or other standard hosts. [gd.eppo](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/PHENHI/download/datasheet_pdf)
- Degree‑day requirements partitioned by egg, each nymphal instar, and pupal stages for males are rarely reported separately; most models use total developmental degree‑days or focus on females. [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18419903/)
- Precise humidity, rainfall wash‑off thresholds, and interactions of temperature × RH × rainfall on survival and dispersal have not been quantified in a systematic way; available evidence is largely qualitative. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8749475/)
- Economic injury levels and economic thresholds specifically for custard apple (by plant part and phenological stage) are not yet standardized; Indian work provides empirical “rules of thumb” but not widely validated models. [agronomyjournals](https://www.agronomyjournals.com/archives/2024/vol7issue9S/PartM/S-7-9-127-471.pdf)
- Detailed quantification of ant–PHM mutualism (ant species lists, measured effects on parasitism/predation rates, and ant‑exclusion experiments) in custard apple orchards is scarce; most data come from other crops and regions. [cabidigitallibrary](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.1079/cabicompendium.40171)

These gaps suggest high‑value research topics: controlled‑environment life‑table studies on Annona hosts, development of Annona‑specific degree‑day and phenology models, and on‑farm trials to define economic thresholds and optimize integration of biological and chemical control in different Indian agro‑ecological zones. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8749475/)

If you want, I can next help you:  

- build structured tables (e.g., stage‑duration vs. temperature, host lists),  
- design a custard‑apple‑specific sampling and threshold protocol based on these sources, or  
- draft the full multi‑section report in your requested format once you’ve decided on length (e.g., MSc thesis chapter vs. review article).
