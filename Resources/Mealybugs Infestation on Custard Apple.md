### Overview of Mealybugs Infestation on Custard Apple

Mealybugs, particularly the pink hibiscus mealybug (*Maconellicoccus hirsutus*), are a major sap-sucking pest affecting custard apple (*Annona squamosa*) trees, especially in tropical and subtropical regions like India. They feed on leaves, twigs, shoots, flowers, and fruits, causing curling, yellowing, stunted growth, and fruit drop. Infestations lead to honeydew secretion, which promotes sooty mold and attracts ants, further reducing yield and fruit quality. Severe cases can result in up to 50-90% yield loss.

### Biology and Life Cycle

Mealybugs have a hemimetabolous life cycle with distinct stages for males and females. Females are wingless, oval-shaped (about 3 mm long), pinkish, and covered in waxy filaments, while males are smaller, winged, and short-lived. Reproduction can be bisexual or parthenogenetic. The life cycle is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and humidity.

Here's a summary of the life cycle stages and durations (based on lab studies at ~19-26°C and 71% RH):

| Stage | Description | Duration (Females) | Duration (Males) |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Egg | Laid in clusters (356-444 per female) within a white waxy ovisac on the female's ventral side or on plant parts like twigs and leaves. Eggs are yellowish to pale orange and translucent. | 3-8 days (mean 5.8 days) | Same as females |
| Nymph (1st Instar/Crawler) | Mobile, pale yellow nymphs that disperse to feeding sites on the plant. They start secreting wax shortly after hatching. | 4-6 days (mean 4.9 days) | 4-8 days (mean 5.5 days) |
| Nymph (2nd Instar) | Less mobile, feeding intensifies; wax covering thickens. | 8-11 days (mean 9.5 days) | 8-13 days (mean 10.3 days) |
| Nymph (3rd Instar) | Females settle and mature; males enter pre-pupal stage. | 7-14 days (mean 11.6 days) | 7-11 days (mean 9.0 days) |
| Pre-Pupa/Pupa | N/A for females (no pupal stage). Males form a cocoon-like structure. | N/A | Pre-pupa: 2-4 days (mean 2.7 days)<br>Pupa: 4-6 days (mean 5.1 days) |
| Adult | Females: Pre-oviposition 5-9 days, oviposition 10-15 days; longevity 25-31 days (total life span 49-57 days).<br>Males: Emerge winged; longevity 3-5 days (total life span 32-40 days). | 25-31 days (mean 27.3 days) | 3-5 days (mean 3.9 days) |
| Total Development (Egg to Adult) | From egg to reproductive adult. | 22-28 days nymphal + egg (total ~53.5 days life span) | 26-36 days (mean 32.8 days) + egg |

Nymphal periods can vary by 21-30 days overall, with males taking longer due to the pupal stage. Under greenhouse conditions, egg-to-adult female development can take about 47 days.

### Favorable Biological and Environmental Conditions

Mealybugs thrive in warm, dry conditions, which promote rapid population growth. Key factors include:

- **Temperature**: Optimal around 19-26°C; populations peak at max temps of ~33-34°C and min ~18°C. Higher temperatures may shorten development time but show negative correlations with population in field studies (r = -0.28 to -0.55).
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**: Prefers lower RH (30-65%); negative correlations observed, especially with evening RH (r = -0.57). High humidity (>70%) can hinder growth and favor natural enemies.
- **Rainfall**: Low or absent rainfall favors buildup; heavy rain (e.g., >135 mm) washes off nymphs and reduces populations (positive but non-significant correlation r = 0.24).
- **Other Factors**: Plant stress (e.g., drought, poor nutrition) reduces resistance. Alternate hosts like hibiscus, okra, guava, and citrus facilitate spread. Ants protect mealybugs from predators, exacerbating infestations.
- **Biological**: Natural enemies like ladybird beetles (*Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*, *Spalgis epius*), parasitoids (*Anagyrus kamali*), and fungi (*Beauveria bassiana*) thrive in humid conditions and can naturally suppress populations (positive correlations r = 0.85 with predators).

Infestations are more severe in tropical climates, with crawlers dispersing via wind, ants, or human activity.

### Stages and Time Periods of Infestation

- **Plant Growth Stages Affected**: Infestations often start on young shoots, leaves, and twigs during the vegetative stage, spreading to flowers and fruits during flowering and fruiting. Crawlers target tender parts; severe damage occurs during fruit development, causing malformation and drop. Trees touching soil or with ground-level branches are more vulnerable as nymphs climb from soil.
- **Seasonal Time Periods**: In regions like India, infestations begin in late summer/early monsoon (around July-September, 29th-37th standard meteorological week) when eggs hatch. Populations build up through October-November, peaking in mid-November (45th week, ~105 mealybugs/fruit) during dry periods post-monsoon. Decline occurs in December-January due to rain, cooler temps, and natural enemies. Eggs may overwinter in soil or on hosts. In greenhouses or warmer climates, multiple generations (up to 8-10/year) can occur year-round.

### Relevant Posts and Discussions

Recent and historical posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlight real-world experiences with mealybugs on custard apple:

- A user reported tall custard apple trees shedding leaves and failing to fruit for four years, suspecting mealybugs as the cause.
- An educational poll from CABI PlantwisePlus featured a photo of mealybugs infesting a custard apple, with users identifying it correctly. The post emphasized crop pest diagnosis.
- General discussions on related crops (e.g., mango) note similar symptoms like leaf curling and sooty mold from mealybug honeydew.

For management, focus on IPM: cultural (pruning, removing hosts), biological (releasing predators like *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* at 30 larvae/plant), and targeted chemicals (e.g., profenophos 0.05%) while monitoring early.
