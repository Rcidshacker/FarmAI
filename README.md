# FarmAI - Custard Apple Pest Management System

FarmAI is an advanced, AI-powered platform designed to assist custard apple farmers in managing pest outbreaks, detecting diseases, and optimizing spray schedules. The system integrates real-time weather data, satellite imagery, and biological models to provide accurate, location-based recommendations.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Disease Detection**: utilizing PyTorch-based CNNs to detect diseases from leaf images.
*   **Pest Prediction**: sophisticated forecasting models (XGBoost) combined with biological risk assessments.
*   **Automated Spray Scheduling**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) based scheduler for optimal chemical usage.
*   **Digital Twin**: Integration of manual observations with satellite indices (NDVI) for precise canopy estimation.
*   **Research Integration**: Automatic retrieval of relevant research papers for disease management.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is divided into two main components:
*   **Backend**: A FastAPI-based server handling AI inference, data processing, and API endpoints.
*   **Frontend**: A modern React application (Vite + TailwindCSS) providing the user interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
*   **Git**: For version control

### 1. Backend Setup

The backend powers the AI and API services.

1.  **Navigate to the project root:**
    ```bash
    cd "backend again"
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: If you have a GPU, ensure you install the CUDA version of PyTorch manually if needed.*

5.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn src.api.app_v2:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
    You can view the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend provides the interactive dashboard.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically run at `http://localhost:5173` (check the console output).
